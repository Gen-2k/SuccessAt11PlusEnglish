                        <p>"Safeguarding" has been defined by the NSPCC (National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children) as the action that is taken to promote children's welfare and protect them from harm. Child protection is part of the safeguarding process. It focusses on protecting individual children who might be at risk of harm.</p>
                        <p>SUCCESS AT 11 PLUS ENGLISH is committed to safeguarding and protecting all children.</p>
                        <p>Some of the Safeguarding and child protection policies and procedures that we follow include:</p>

                                <li>We carry out DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) checks at the required level</li>
                                <li>We obtain at-least 2 (two) references in respect of a candidate that we have interviewed</li>
                                <li>We verify a potential candidate's right to remain and work in the United Kingdom</li>
                                <li>We do not confirm employment until we have received a satisfactory DBS check report, and satisfactory feedback from the referees</li>

If a child is shy or for any reason not comfortable turning on their webcam, or you as a Parent have concerns relating to the use of a webcam by your child please discuss the situation with us. Please note that a student will be asked to use their webcam only for the purposes of participating in class activities and not for any other purpose. In addition every student must be supervised by a Parent for the duration of their online class with us. Please note that Parents must fill out a consent form, expressly consenting to their children attending online classes delivered by us and including, without limitation the use of cameras during the online class.</p>

                            <p>We take the wellbeing of children and young people enrolled onto our courses seriously and therefore if a member of our staff sees or hears something worrying during an online lesson, or if a child discloses abuse during a phone call or via email, we may if necessary contact the NSPCC (National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children) who will take the necessary action to protect the child or young person</p>
