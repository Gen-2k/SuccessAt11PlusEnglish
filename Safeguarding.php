                        <p>Child Protection: At <strong>SUCCESS AT 11 PLUS ENGLISH</strong>, we consider our responsibilities to protect children from abuse to be paramount. We will act on all child protection concerns, including those relating to physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect. All child protection concerns that emerge during lesson time are recorded and passed onto the designated lead to act upon as appropriate.</p>
                        <p>All staff are trained in safeguarding children and are DBS checked. All such is updated as required by relevant bodies. Designated lead for Child Protection and safeguarding is Mrs Kiran Deep</p>
                        <p><strong>SUCCESS AT 11 PLUS ENGLISH</strong> is committed to building a 'culture of safety' in which the children in our care are protected from abuse, harm and radicalisation.</p>
                        <p>The school will respond promptly and appropriately to all incidents or concerns regarding the safety of a child that may occur. The school's child protection procedures comply with all relevant legislation and with guidance issued by the Local Safeguarding Children Board (LSCB).</p>
                        <p>The Club's Designated Safeguarding Person (DSP) is Safrina Saran. The DSP co-ordinates child protection issues and liaises with external agencies (e.g.Children, School and Families, the LSCB and LADO(local authority designated officer) Bexleyheath.</p>

                    <div class="card-header">Child abuse and neglect</div>
                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p>Child abuse is any form of physical, emotional or sexual mistreatment or lack of care that leads to injury or harm. An individual may abuse or neglect a child directly, or by failing to protect them from harm. Some forms of child abuse and neglect are listed below.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Emotional abuse is the persistent emotional maltreatment of a child so as to cause severe and persistent adverse effects on the child's emotional development. It may involve making the child feel that they are worthless, unloved, or inadequate. Some level of emotional abuse is involved in all types of maltreatment of a child, though it may occur alone.</li>
                            <li>Physical abuse can involve hitting, shaking, throwing, poisoning, burning, drowning,suffocating or otherwise causing physical harm to a child. Physical harm may be also caused when a parent or carer feigns the symptoms of, or deliberately causes, ill health to a child.</li>
                            <li>Sexual abuse involves forcing or enticing a child to take part in sexual activities, whether or not the child is aware of what is happening. This can involve physical contact, or non-contact activities such as showing children sexual activities or encouraging them to behave in sexually inappropriate ways.</li>
                            <li>Neglect is the persistent failure to meet a child's basic physical and emotional needs. It can involve a failure to provide adequate food, clothing and shelter, to protect a child from physicaland emotional harm, to ensure adequate supervision or to allow access to medical treatment.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>deterioration in a child's general well-being</li>
                            <li>unexplained bruising or marks</li>

                        <p>When a child makes a disclosure to a member of staff, that member of staff will:</p>

                            <li>reassure the child that they were not to blame and were right to speak out</li>

If they will not do so, we will explain that the Club is obliged to and the incident will be logged accordingly.</p>

                        <p>Children are vulnerable to abuse by their peers. Peer-on-peer abuse is taken seriously by staff and will be subject to the same child protection procedures as other forms of abuse. Staff are aware of the potential uses of information technology for bullying and abusive behaviour between young people.</p>
                        <p>Staff will not dismiss abusive behaviour as normal between young people. The presence of one or more of the following in relationships between children should always trigger concern about the possibility of peer-on-peer abuse:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sexual activity (in primary school-aged children) of any kind, including sexting</li>

                            <li>One of the children is significantly more vulnerable than the other(s) (e.g. in terms of disability, confidence, physical strength)</li>
                            <li>There has been some use of threats, bribes or coercion to ensure compliance or secrecy. If peer-on-peer abuse is suspected or disclosed, we will follow the same procedures as set out above for responding to child abuse.</li>
